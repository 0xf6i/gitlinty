Gitlinty is a GitHub repository linter developed as a school project at Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH). This tool is designed to help developers ensure their repositories meet industry standards by checking for misconfigured licenses, README files, workflow files, and overall repository health.

## Features

- **License Checking:** Validates the presence and correctness of licenses in the repository.
- **README Validation:** Ensures that the README file is properly formatted and exists.
- **Workflow Analysis:** Analyzes workflow files to confirm they are configured correctly and adhere to best practices.
- **Health Report:** Provides a summary of the repository’s health, highlighting areas that need improvement.
